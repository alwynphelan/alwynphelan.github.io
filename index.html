        <p3>When a user uses a website for the first time the first thing they expect is a positive display of usability and accessibility. Whether they seek this knowingly or not it's crucial. A website I have used to review the usability and accessibility of is Reddit. I will be looking at the different sections of reddit in detail. I will be using headings to show good and bad examples of the usability. I will be using the usability heuristics to showcase.</p3>
