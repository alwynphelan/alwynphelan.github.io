        <h1>Conclusion</h1>

        <h3 class="task1">Postives</h3>
        <p4 class="work1">I found that Reddit is a very easy and simple website to use. It is easy to customise your profile. You're allowed to have custom avatars and names. The website gives users the ability to create posts which gives them freedom to play around with. It was very accessible for new users to find topics by using the search system. The website was capable of successfully following many of usability hueristics.</p4>

        <h3 class="weezer">Negatives</h3> 
        <p4 class="weez">I did find negatives in site, however. The first one and the most important was the design. The design for the site is relatively lazy yet complicated. The lack of colors made areas of the site difficult to locate i.e search bar and post creation. The layout had also made areas hard to access like the help center which I had struggled to find. </p4>

        <h3 class="brewers">Overall</h3>
        <p4 class="brew">I had fairly high hopes going into the review. I had never had problems using Reddit, however, when it came to using areas such as help and post creating during the review I was lost. I think that overall Reddit had come close to my expectations. I was very satisfied with the layout, cutomising and ease to search. The site could definitely work to make a much cleaner and colorful layout. They need to make things more visible and especially move the help center into an easier place to acess. The site needs to be more visually attractive to not just maintain users but to pull in newer people.</p4>

        <h3 class="result1">Results</h3>
        <p4 class="res1">Besides making it hard to access the page to create a post page. Luckily, the actual creation of a post is quite easy to do and gives the user enough creative control to play around with.</p4>
